# ATM MACHINE SIMULATION
This project is a Python-based ATM machine simulation that provides a command-line interface for users to perform various banking operations. It consists of an Account class that manages individual account details, including balance and transaction history, and an ATM class that manages multiple accounts. Users can create accounts with unique account numbers and PINs, and perform operations such as balance inquiries, cash deposits, cash withdrawals, PIN changes, and viewing transaction history. The main function of the program offers a user-friendly menu for navigating these functionalities. This simulation serves as an educational tool for understanding basic banking operations and object-oriented programming in Python.
